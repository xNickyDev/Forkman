Introducing **Forkman 2.0**!

Over the last month we've been working hard and long to completely revamp Forkman. You may not notice any differences when using commands or features, but let us tell you; A lot has changed! We mainly focused on improving important things like performance and the various capabilities of the bot. This means that the bot has completely changed for us, especially the codes and hosting. We are already proud of it and would love to share it with you!

In this announcement, we're introducing exactly **3 newly added features** to Forkman. Stay tuned!

## 1. Hangman Game Stats
The Hangman game has received an update! You can now see various statistics of your Hangman gameplay. Additionally, we have added two leaderboards: **Wins Leaderboard** and **Best Time Leaderboard**. They show the 3 best players in each category.

Guess Wolvesville roles correctly and climb to the top of the 3 best Hangman players!

The Question game has also received an update! You can now purchase **+5 Seconds** to increase the countdown timer by 5 seconds and you can purchase **Gold Multipliers** to earn a higher amount of gold for each question answered correctly. We have also added personal statistics to this game: **Highest Streak** and **Questions Count**.

> **Highest Streak**: Displays your highest question streak ever.\
> **Questions Count**: Displays the total number of questions you answered correctly.

For each of these new stats, there are 2 separate leaderboards to honor the top 3 players in this game ðŸ¥‡

### Known Bugs & Problems
- Colors of `-profile` and `-clan` are not 100% working correctly and may cause the bot to crash if an invalid hex is returned by the API. A required function to prevent this is currently missing. (may be fixed)
- `-help` cannot return info regarding commands. Right now only the `page` parameter is working.
- The **Language** field of `-clan` displays the country code instead of the actual language. This is a temporary solution until the issue is resolved.
- Clicking trough clan pages from `-clan` can sometimes cause the bot to crash. At this point we don't know what the problem is nor how we can fix it. If you encounter this issue, please contact us **immediately**!
