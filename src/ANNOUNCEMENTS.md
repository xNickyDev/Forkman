Introducing **Forkman 2.0**!

Over the last month we've been working hard and long to completely revamp Forkman. You may not notice any differences when using commands or features, but let us tell you; A lot has changed! We mainly focused on improving important things like performance and the various capabilities of the bot. This means that the bot has completely changed for us, especially the codes and hosting. We are already proud of it and would love to share it with you!

In this announcement, we're introducing exactly **3 newly added features** to Forkman. Stay tuned!

## 1.  Hangman Game Stats
The Hangman game has received an update! You can now see various statistics of your Hangman gameplay. Additionally, we have added two leaderboards: **Wins Leaderboard** and **Best Time Leaderboard**. They show the 3 best players in each category.

Guess Wolvesville roles correctly and climb to the top of the 3 best Hangman players!
