### Maintenance Completed
The maintenance of Forkman is now completed and we had a small data loss but overall everything else went smoothly. Users who played games with Forkman after the date of 06/06/2024 9:05 PM might have their new game progress not saved. Affected users are welcome to contact me to get their game data updated. I'm very sorry for the small inconvenience and happy to announce upcoming updates! üëÄ

### Upcoming Maintenance
Forkman will be undergoing maintenance during the upcoming weekend to change some important database stuff. The bot remains locked or even offline during this process until all data has been successfully transferred. This means that you will not be able to use any commands or features of Forkman until maintenance is completed.\
We will announce when maintenance has started and finished!

Thanks for your understanding! ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Upcoming Deprecation of Prefix Commands

We will deprecate and remove the use of prefix commands once Forkman is officially verified by Discord and reached a total of **100** servers. We're already posting this announcement as a friendly message to slowly start migrating to the fancy slash commands ü§ô If you prefer to use the prefix commands, that's totally fine! Everything continues running smoothly until we are forced to switch to slash commands only ‚ú®

If you have any complaints, suggestions or questions, please feel free to talk to us through the dedicated channels on our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/DEEZY5cwpy). Thank you for using Forkman! ‚ù§Ô∏è
